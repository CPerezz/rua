Possible features to implement (until it becomes heavy enough for issue tracker):

support non-amd64 architectures (seccomp is the blocker)
do something smart about AUR package caching
AUR upstream diff
patching AUR packages
use libalpm instead of `pacman` commands: https://crates.io/crates/libalpm
