Possible features to implement (until it becomes heavy enough for issue tracker):

do something smart about AUR package caching
eager invocation of sudo, if explicitly enabled in config
upstream AUR diff
local AUR packages
add to arch wiki once it's publicly released
use libalpm instead of `pacman` commands, to speed-up: https://crates.io/crates/libalpm
